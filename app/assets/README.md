# Assets Directory

This directory is maintained as it is required by Rails Sprockets to link and precompile assets.

## Recommendation

For adding any JavaScript files, images, or stylesheets, use the `public/javascripts`, `public/images`, and `public/stylesheets` folders instead of this directory.
